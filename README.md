# Visualizing Global Temperature and Environmental Trends

This repository contains the code, data, and report for a project focused on visualizing global temperature and various environmental trends from 2000 to 2024. The project aims to provide clear, data-driven insights into climate change indicators across multiple countries using Python for data analysis and visualization.

## üìä Project Overview

The core objective of this project is to explore and visualize the interrelationships between average temperatures, CO2 emissions, sea-level rise, and other key environmental factors. By transforming complex datasets into intuitive graphs and charts, this study highlights significant climate patterns and their evolution over the past two decades.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** In-depth exploration of environmental indicators across 19 countries.
*   **Time-Series Visualization:** Tracking of average temperature trends over time.
*   **Comparative Country Analysis:** Visual comparison of temperature trends and other metrics between different nations.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Investigation of relationships between temperature, CO2 emissions, and sea-level rise.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Leveraging libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for impactful data presentation.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Google Colab (Recommended)

The easiest way to explore and run the project is through Google Colab:

1.  Click on the following link: [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sXBVnYkYUC6_nQOYeFSfdd_vNG3p97eH)
2.  Once in Colab, you can run all cells sequentially (`Runtime > Run all`) to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

### Local Environment

To run the project locally, ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7+).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YourUsername` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub details)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy plotly
    ```

3.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python visualizing_time_series_dataset_global_temp_data.py
    ```
    Alternatively, if you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can open and run the `.ipynb` file.

## üìö About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is titled "**Temperature, Emissions & Environmental Trends (2000-2024)**". It provides a comprehensive overview of key environmental indicators collected over a span of 24 years (2000‚Äì2024) across multiple countries. It is designed to support analyses that explore the interplay between climate variables, human activities, and environmental changes. The dataset is particularly useful for researchers, data scientists, and policy analysts interested in climate change, sustainability, and environmental impact studies.
